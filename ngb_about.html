		<p class="site_body">
		As part of our ongoing efforts to build a better bank following our improper sales practice announcement in September 2016, we are looking across our entire company to identify and fix problems, 
		be transparent and open about what we find, and make things right. We set aside $142 million for customer remediation and settlement expenses. 
		</p> <p class="site_body">
		We also pledged to conduct a review of our business practices. In following through on that commitment, weâ€™ve identified additional problem areas that we are in the process of addressing. 
		And we made them public as part of our renewed commitment to transparency.
